<p>I traveled to <a href="https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Qazvin">Qazvin </a>a while ago. Not because I chose Qazvin, just because Tehran&#8217;s air was very polluted and we left the city to get rid of it. Again, our goal was not to travel to Qazvin, according to the habit of people in Tehran, we rode on the <a href="https://irandoostan.com/chaloos-the-most-beautiful-road-in-iran/">Chalous road</a>, which kept us from continuing the path to the long traffic lane of the road. So we turned away and turned to <a href="https://wikitravel.org/en/Karaj">Karaj</a>. We hopelessly checked out the available facilities to retreat back home. <g class="gr_ gr_11 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="11" data-gr-id="11">Eventually</g> we decided to go to Qazvin. We were not very optimistic about the choice, but there was no other option. On the way, thanks to the Internet, we went looking for a few hotels and eventually contacting one of the traditional hotels, <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.co.za/Hotel_Review-g680026-d11663937-Reviews-Traditional_Behrouzi_Hotel-Qazvin_Qazvin_Province.html">traditional Behrouzi hotel</a>.</p>



<p>I do not know how many times I&#8217;ve been to Qazvin province. I even traveled to the surrounding villages and nature of the province, once I stopped at my friend’s student Dormitory one night in Qazvin, but I never looked at Qazvin as a tourist destination.</p>



<p>This time it was important from the moment of my arrival to the city. Wide streets that have made it easy to get a positive feel to the traveler. The city was alive and, despite the heavy rains, people were in the streets.</p>



<p>We followed the map to get to the hotel location. A hotel in a traditional home in the city of Qazvin. In our path I saw the old bazaar. The excitement took me all the way, so after chek-in, we immediately went out. The rain was heavy. The S<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caravanserai_of_Sa%27d_al-Saltaneh">adosaltaneh Caravanserai </a>was the first place to go. The beauty of restoration and maintenance was beyond my imagination. Cafes were located there and helped experience a good sense of eating and drinking in the old space. We stayed a bit there and then returned to the hotel for a break.</p>



<p>The next day, we left the hotel to visit the bazaar, <a href="http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/cehel-sotun-qazvin-a-safavid-pavilion-that-stands-amid-gardens-in-the-central-meydan-square-of-the-old-city-and-in-w">Chehel Sotun</a>, <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/iran/qazvin/attractions/ali-qapu/a/poi-sig/1121005/361035">Aliqapu</a>, <a href="http://destription.com/en/iran/attraction/safavi-gardens-collection">Safavi Garden complex</a>, Naderi mansion, Mirza Karim bath, Barajin Tower and &#8230;. Every moment that I touched the sights of Qazvin, and every time I looked at people&#8217;s life, the question came to me about why I have never visited Qazvin so far? It was not only strange to me, my husband had the same experience. We have been passing over from Qazvin many times and we have never been to this city full of spectacular places.</p>



<p>Has not Qazvin been the capital of the Safavids before <a href="https://en.unesco.org/silkroad/content/isfahan">Isfahan</a>? Is not that what we have in Isfahan,its primary sample is in Qazvin? Was not the  first modern Iranian street in Qazvin? So why Isfahan is half the world and Qazvin is just a city between the way?</p>



<p>I do not know if the proximity of this city to Tehran has exacerbated its beauty and majesty, or the people there, &nbsp;themselves are not interested in attracting tourists too much.This unawareness of a beautiful city and close to capital of Iran make me think about how many other places in Iran I have just gone through? </p>



<p>My trip to Qazvin was less than two days. After returning every moment I think about there and look forward to a trip again, this time with planning and for a longer time to this city. Qazvin should not be lost.<br /></p>

<p></p>



<p> I am a Tour Guide. I have led a lot of group tours over the past 7 years. I always believed that a tour guide is a teacher, but a trip teacher. Traveling alongside people with a lot of personalities is interesting for me. People of different ages with different abilities to endure travel difficulties. About 2 years ago, when I realized that I am pregnant,  I had to change <a href="https://irandestina.com/maryams-story/">my lifestyle</a>, so abandon tour guiding. It is a job that quickly disappears from daily activities.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kharanaq-5-4.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1650" srcset="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kharanaq-5-4.jpg 1000w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kharanaq-5-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kharanaq-5-4-768x511.jpg 768w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kharanaq-5-4-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure>



<p>In the past two years, I&#8217;ve traveled less than my previous life. Whether pregnancy or breastfeeding, and afterwards, it is not easy to travel with an infant. </p>



<p>About a month ago, I decided to break this period when my husband suggested traveling to <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/iran/kharanaq">Kharanaq</a>. 10 years ago, my husband and I met each other in <a href="https://en.unesco.org/silkroad/photo-bank/kharanaq-caravanserai">Kharanq Caravanserai</a>. He suggested celebrating the 10th anniversary in the same place. It was not easy for me. stepping with a 14-month-old son in this way, I thought it was madness. At first, I did not accept that, but later, with the support of two of my friends (<a href="https://irandestina.com/parastoos-story/">Parastoo </a>and <a href="https://irandestina.com/shamims-story/">Shamim </a>who work together these days), I accepted. So we planned a 3.5-days trip to Kharandagh, a village in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yazd_Province">Yazd province</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kharanaq-2-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1639" srcset="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kharanaq-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kharanaq-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kharanaq-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kharanaq-2-600x400.jpg 600w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kharanaq-2.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Coordination began. After each phone-call I took for the trip, I had to feed my son or help him for sleeping or clean him. My friends and husband took some responsibility to help me. When the train ticket was opened on the railroad site, I had to buy it quickly, because it could be all reserved and we could lose&nbsp;the train. We all did it in the space where the child was crying. We must had written 35 names and 35 families and 35 national codes without the slightest error. Eventually, the tickets were purchased.</p>



<p>At nights, I was dreaming the nightmare that I lost the train, and the passengers, with the guidance of my 14-month-old son, started the trip. I provided a list of what to do and checked it many times each day.</p>



<p><a href="https://irandestina.com/parastoos-story/">Parastoo</a>, <a href="https://irandestina.com/shamims-story/">Shamim</a>, my husband and I, managed the tour during the trip. A tour of 35 people between 14 months to 70 years old. There were 3 other children on the tour, beside my son.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Maryam-and-Shamim-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1641" srcset="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Maryam-and-Shamim-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Maryam-and-Shamim-300x200.jpg 300w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Maryam-and-Shamim-768x512.jpg 768w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Maryam-and-Shamim-600x400.jpg 600w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Maryam-and-Shamim.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>I didn&#8217;t sleep the night before the trip for various reasons. We were in the railway at 4 am before the rest. Everyone got together and the besides started. My child was sleeping in the carriage. One side of my mind was occupied by the guard for the ticket, another place to count all the passengers and at the same time worried about losing the carriage in the crowd.</p>



<p>When we arrived in Yazd, we were in charge of picking up passengers and riding a bus. I still was worried about losing the carriage. When I arrived at the Shah Abbasi Caravanserai, where we were supposed to spend 2 nights. I was responsible for setting the dinner, breakfast, the cold temperature of the rooms, the health of the passengers, along with a crying child who and couldn&#8217;t sleep and eat. To the end, I was sure I would not see the morning.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kharanaq-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1643" srcset="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kharanaq-1.jpg 992w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kharanaq-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kharanaq-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kharanaq-1-600x450.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 992px) 100vw, 992px" /></figure>



<p>But I saw the morning, and we drove into the desert with travelers who were better than my imagination. The storm of sand in the desert and the destruction of one of the cars, along with the fear of damaging the child&#8217;s lungs, changed my mood again. The night we were all around the caravanserai, I felt calm.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kharanaq-3-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1642" srcset="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kharanaq-3-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kharanaq-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kharanaq-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kharanaq-3-600x400.jpg 600w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kharanaq-3.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The last day of the trip, visiting Meybod and Ardakan and <g class="gr_ gr_73 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep" id="73" data-gr-id="73">Yazd,</g> made the trip a bit heavy. At all these times costs should be calculated, we set hours to do so, and each time we should count passengers. At 8 o&#8217;clock we boarded the train. I felt like I was in a race and now is near the finish line. I counted <g class="gr_ gr_9 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling multiReplace" id="9" data-gr-id="9">everyone</g>. I put the baby carriage in front of me and slept with the train shuffles.</p>



<p>In the morning, when we all came to Tehran with smile, I had a dual sense. Whether I have achieved success or went under the risk of stupidity? I still do not know. I don&#8217;t even know shall I advise anyone or not. Anyway, my friends, my husband and I did it all together.<br /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everything began with the wishes of my childhood. That&#8217;s when I decided to be a travel writer. I wished to travel and write about unknowns, different lives, different cultures, and diverse nature. As I grew up, many of these aspirations were lost during the days.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1424" src="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Meramous.jpg" alt="Maryam Mousavi" width="1000" height="1500" srcset="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Meramous.jpg 1000w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Meramous-200x300.jpg 200w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Meramous-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Meramous-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Meramous-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I did not become a writer then I studied at the Bachelor of Engineering in Chemistry. For years I worked at the insurance company, cinema, newspapers, and magazines, but I never had the full satisfaction. In 2009, I met a man who marries me three years later. We have a 1-year old son. My husband helped me determine my career path further. He advised me to see the journey professionally.</span></p>
<p><figure id="attachment_1422" style="width: 1000px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1422" src="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MeraGood-Damavand.jpg" alt="MeraGood Damavand" width="1000" height="666" srcset="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MeraGood-Damavand.jpg 1000w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MeraGood-Damavand-300x200.jpg 300w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MeraGood-Damavand-768x511.jpg 768w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MeraGood-Damavand-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Our Family</figcaption></figure></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> After that, I became a cultural and natural tour leader. I studied Master of tourism management. Then I met my traveler friends in university who are my colleagues today. In these years I have searched in the tourism industry and see what I like most. I chose sustainable tourism development. I work voluntarily and non-voluntarily in various activities in this field. It is pleasant for me to be active in any field of tourism that boosts local communities&#8217; economic, environmental, peace and friendship and any positive developments in the world. Tourism is a way for me to make my dreams true.<br />
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1423" src="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MeraGood.jpg" alt="MeraGood" width="1000" height="666" srcset="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MeraGood.jpg 1000w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MeraGood-300x200.jpg 300w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MeraGood-768x511.jpg 768w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MeraGood-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Today I am a traveler mom. We started traveling with my husband since my son was only 50 days old. This way will continue. Irandestina is a way for me to achieve all this journey and experience and peace together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">P.S. My child&#8217;s name is “Damavand”. <a href="https://irandestina.com/three-giant-monsters-mountains-in-iran/">Damavand</a> is the highest peak in Iran.</span></p>
