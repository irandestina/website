		<description><![CDATA[Hello Juan, Thank you for your comment. 
There is no daily card or 48 hours for the airport, but when you buy the ticket you can use it whenever you want. There is a chargeable ticket for Other lines of the Tehran metro so you can use for your whole trip. 
I updated the timetable in the article. From Shahre Aftab there are shared taxies to IKA airport.]]></description>
