				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everything began with the wishes of my childhood. That&#8217;s when I decided to be a travel writer. I wished to travel and write about unknowns, different lives, different cultures, and diverse nature. As I grew up, many of these aspirations were lost during the days.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1424" src="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Meramous.jpg" alt="Maryam Mousavi" width="1000" height="1500" srcset="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Meramous.jpg 1000w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Meramous-200x300.jpg 200w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Meramous-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Meramous-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Meramous-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I did not become a writer then I studied at the Bachelor of Engineering in Chemistry. For years I worked at the insurance company, cinema, newspapers, and magazines, but I never had the full satisfaction. In 2009, I met a man who marries me three years later. We have a 1-year old son. My husband helped me determine my career path further. He advised me to see the journey professionally.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_1422" style="width: 1000px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1422" src="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MeraGood-Damavand.jpg" alt="MeraGood Damavand" width="1000" height="666" srcset="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MeraGood-Damavand.jpg 1000w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MeraGood-Damavand-300x200.jpg 300w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MeraGood-Damavand-768x511.jpg 768w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MeraGood-Damavand-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Our Family</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> After that, I became a cultural and natural tour leader. I studied Master of tourism management. Then I met my traveler friends in university who are my colleagues today. In these years I have searched in the tourism industry and see what I like most. I chose sustainable tourism development. I work voluntarily and non-voluntarily in various activities in this field. It is pleasant for me to be active in any field of tourism that boosts local communities&#8217; economic, environmental, peace and friendship and any positive developments in the world. Tourism is a way for me to make my dreams true.<br />

</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Today I am a traveler mom. We started traveling with my husband since my son was only 50 days old. This way will continue. Irandestina is a way for me to achieve all this journey and experience and peace together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">P.S. My child&#8217;s name is “Damavand”. <a href="https://irandestina.com/three-giant-monsters-mountains-in-iran/">Damavand</a> is the highest peak in Iran.</span></p>
