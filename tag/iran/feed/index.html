<p>I think my experience in <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/iran">Iran </a>has been slightly different from that of a traveller, as I went there for a course of Persian at <a href="https://icps.ut.ac.ir/index-e.html">Dehkhoda Institute</a>.</p>



<p>I spent forty days there, and I have stayed primarily in <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/iran/tehran">Tehran</a>, where the Institute was. I only traveled to Shiraz for a weekend and to <a href="https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Sari">Sari </a>(in the North, near the<a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Caspian-Sea"> Caspian se</a>a) for another weekend. I had been in Iran before and I had back then visited Esfahan too.</p>



<p>Well, let me start with <a href="https://wikitravel.org/en/Isfahan">Esfahan</a>. They call the city “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isfahan">nesf-e jahan</a>”, half of the world, which in itself is not very surprising, if you think that there are many cities around the world where proud inhabitants make up phrases and expressions to promote the beauty and the unicity of the city itself (think about <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Naples">Naples, “vedi Napoli e poi muori</a>” or <a href="https://es.wikiquote.org/wiki/Granada">Granada</a>, “has llegado a Granada, lo mejor del mundo entero”). Well, I have to admit that few things I saw had on me the effect of seeing Naqsh-e Jahan Square in Esfahan. And not only the square makes you feel like you would like to spend some more time or even some years in that city, but also the streets full of young families having picnics everywhere you see grass, or the men sitting under <a href="http://www.bridgesdb.com/bridge-list/siosepol-bridge/">si-o se pol</a>, singing forbidden songs, promptly interrupted by the guards, when a too big crowd gathers to listen.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img src="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Azadi-Tower-683x1024.jpg" alt="" data-id="1727" data-link="https://irandestina.com/?attachment_id=1727" class="wp-image-1727" srcset="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Azadi-Tower-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Azadi-Tower-200x300.jpg 200w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Azadi-Tower-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Azadi-Tower-600x900.jpg 600w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Azadi-Tower.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" /><figcaption>Tehran</figcaption></figure></li></ul>



<p>Admittedly, going back to Tehran, having spent some days in cities like Esfahan or <a href="https://wikitravel.org/en/Shiraz">Shiraz</a>, is a pure nightmare: the city is pregnant with smog, pollution, heavy air that makes you feel tired only after walking a kilometer on your feet, if you have survived to cross the streets in the middle of the busiest traffic you can imagine. But Tehran is unfortunately the heart of Iran, the political thermometer, the city where everything is possible: seeing a woman moving around with her headscarf fallen off her head, high heels and very very tight clothes, that don’t leave much to imagination, and seeing another one all covered up in her black chador, the two walking together hand in hand. Hidden house parties where as soon as you arrive, everyone goes to take off the many layers of clothes they were wearing on the streets and hurries to get drunk, and religious processions where believers flog themselves to the point of bleeding.</p>



<p>I see Iran as a country of paradox, a mixture of ancestral <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoroastrians_in_Iran">Zoroastrian</a> culture, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_Iran">Islamic </a>culture, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_culture">western culture,</a> <g class="gr_ gr_21 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="21" data-gr-id="21">and</g> <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/autochthonous">autochthonous </a>Iranian modern culture.</p>



<p>And books: books are everywhere, books are scattered down on the pavement, on the piece of cloth where they are exposed by the street seller; books are staying orderly inside a book machine dispenser; books in the small <a href="https://theculturetrip.com/middle-east/iran/articles/the-6-best-bookshops-in-tehran-you-should-visit/">library in Enghelab</a> street where they organize weekly discussions about literature; books are in the hands of the women who fill the metro during pick hours in Tehran; books are everywhere. Poetry is everywhere too: in the speech of the taxi driver, in the song coming from the radio, in the recommendation of the grandmother while you are leaving her house, after helping her wash the dishes; in the air at the <a href="https://www.destinationiran.com/visit-mausoleum-of-hafez-the-persian-poet-in-shiraz.htm">mausoleum of Hafez</a> in Shiraz, crowded at whichever time you visit it, with people from all over the country.</p>



<p>Iran is the Persian teacher who will tell you more about the history of your own country than yourself have ever known. Iran is the incredible corners that open up unexpectedly while you are walking on the most common-looking street of Shiraz or Tehran, it’s the <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293999-d15139619-Reviews-Baccara_Cafe-Tehran_Tehran_Province.html">small café</a> where you sit in an exquisite patio with a fountain in the middle and flowers all around. It’s Harry Potter café in Tehran, with the very young waitress who jumps up and down out of joy because she could exchange some French words with you; it’s Parvaneh market in Tehran, where all wishes come true, and all you ever wanted to buy is there, if you look closely and spend your morning going around its five floors. Iran is seeing a man walking his dog around with pride, in spite of the ban on possessing dogs, as they are supposedly haram.</p>



<p>Iran is many things, many people, and a huge country of which I only lived a small part, but where you will realise that, to say it with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_Angelou">Maya Angelou</a>, “we are more alike, my friends, than we are unalike”.</p>

<p>I traveled to <a href="https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Qazvin">Qazvin </a>a while ago. Not because I chose Qazvin, just because Tehran&#8217;s air was very polluted and we left the city to get rid of it. Again, our goal was not to travel to Qazvin, according to the habit of people in Tehran, we rode on the <a href="https://irandoostan.com/chaloos-the-most-beautiful-road-in-iran/">Chalous road</a>, which kept us from continuing the path to the long traffic lane of the road. So we turned away and turned to <a href="https://wikitravel.org/en/Karaj">Karaj</a>. We hopelessly checked out the available facilities to retreat back home. <g class="gr_ gr_11 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="11" data-gr-id="11">Eventually</g> we decided to go to Qazvin. We were not very optimistic about the choice, but there was no other option. On the way, thanks to the Internet, we went looking for a few hotels and eventually contacting one of the traditional hotels, <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.co.za/Hotel_Review-g680026-d11663937-Reviews-Traditional_Behrouzi_Hotel-Qazvin_Qazvin_Province.html">traditional Behrouzi hotel</a>.</p>



<p>I do not know how many times I&#8217;ve been to Qazvin province. I even traveled to the surrounding villages and nature of the province, once I stopped at my friend’s student Dormitory one night in Qazvin, but I never looked at Qazvin as a tourist destination.</p>



<p>This time it was important from the moment of my arrival to the city. Wide streets that have made it easy to get a positive feel to the traveler. The city was alive and, despite the heavy rains, people were in the streets.</p>



<p>We followed the map to get to the hotel location. A hotel in a traditional home in the city of Qazvin. In our path I saw the old bazaar. The excitement took me all the way, so after chek-in, we immediately went out. The rain was heavy. The S<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caravanserai_of_Sa%27d_al-Saltaneh">adosaltaneh Caravanserai </a>was the first place to go. The beauty of restoration and maintenance was beyond my imagination. Cafes were located there and helped experience a good sense of eating and drinking in the old space. We stayed a bit there and then returned to the hotel for a break.</p>



<p>The next day, we left the hotel to visit the bazaar, <a href="http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/cehel-sotun-qazvin-a-safavid-pavilion-that-stands-amid-gardens-in-the-central-meydan-square-of-the-old-city-and-in-w">Chehel Sotun</a>, <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/iran/qazvin/attractions/ali-qapu/a/poi-sig/1121005/361035">Aliqapu</a>, <a href="http://destription.com/en/iran/attraction/safavi-gardens-collection">Safavi Garden complex</a>, Naderi mansion, Mirza Karim bath, Barajin Tower and &#8230;. Every moment that I touched the sights of Qazvin, and every time I looked at people&#8217;s life, the question came to me about why I have never visited Qazvin so far? It was not only strange to me, my husband had the same experience. We have been passing over from Qazvin many times and we have never been to this city full of spectacular places.</p>



<p>Has not Qazvin been the capital of the Safavids before <a href="https://en.unesco.org/silkroad/content/isfahan">Isfahan</a>? Is not that what we have in Isfahan,its primary sample is in Qazvin? Was not the  first modern Iranian street in Qazvin? So why Isfahan is half the world and Qazvin is just a city between the way?</p>



<p>I do not know if the proximity of this city to Tehran has exacerbated its beauty and majesty, or the people there, &nbsp;themselves are not interested in attracting tourists too much.This unawareness of a beautiful city and close to capital of Iran make me think about how many other places in Iran I have just gone through? </p>



<p>My trip to Qazvin was less than two days. After returning every moment I think about there and look forward to a trip again, this time with planning and for a longer time to this city. Qazvin should not be lost.<br /></p>

<p>For the ones coming from Southern Europe (like me), Iran is pretty familiar. Family and food are a predominant part of everyone&#8217;s life. For the ones coming from the North, well it might look quite &#8220;exotic&#8221;, but very easily approachable. The country is huge, and even if you decide to undertake the most common itinerary (as I did) through <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/iran/tehran">Teheran</a>, <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/iran/central-iran/kashan">Kashan</a>, <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/iran/central-iran/esfahan">Isfahan</a>, <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/iran/central-iran/yazd">Yazd</a>, and <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/iran/central-iran/shiraz">Shiraz</a>, you’ll have the feeling that everywhere in Iran you might face a hidden gem, and that’s true.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img src="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/A-mural-painting-in-Teheran-1024x768.jpg" alt="" data-id="1683" data-link="https://irandestina.com/?attachment_id=1683" class="wp-image-1683" srcset="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/A-mural-painting-in-Teheran-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/A-mural-painting-in-Teheran-300x225.jpg 300w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/A-mural-painting-in-Teheran-768x576.jpg 768w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/A-mural-painting-in-Teheran-600x450.jpg 600w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/A-mural-painting-in-Teheran.jpg 1144w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>A mural painting in Teheran</figcaption></figure></li></ul>



<p>Every single region is spotted by great cities, archaeological sites or simply nice places to spend a couple of days. I was in Iran ten years ago for a long time and I still remember how hard it was to plan a decent trip through the whole country because time is never enough. That’s a kind of frustrating, but it’s also the reason of why the 90% (I think) of travelers want to go back.</p>



<p> So that’s my suggestion: take your time, and don’t presume to cover Iran in a two-three weeks trip. Forget it. Choose an area and explore it, and leave the others for further journeys. I did the classic tour in 17 days and <g class="gr_ gr_19 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="19" data-gr-id="19">still</g> I had to rush from one city to another. Simply because places in Iran (both social and cultural) are above all interesting places where you’ll <em>need</em> to spend time observing people around, admiring a mosque detail, sitting and <g class="gr_ gr_18 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace" id="18" data-gr-id="18">breathe</g>. That’s the experience. Don’t miss it just because you want to see both<a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/iran/northeastern-iran/mashhad"> Mashhad</a> and <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/iran/western-iran/tabriz">Tabriz</a>. </p>

<h2><br />So here some places you could easily spend a half a day&nbsp;</h2>



<ol><li><a href="https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1397">Masjid-e-Jāmeh, Isfahan</a> &#8211; It’s unique, literally. I never saw a mosque combining together so many islamic architectural styles. And it’s huge, calm and evocative. Speech-less. </li><li><a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g316021-d6415139-Reviews-Madrese_e_Khan-Shiraz_Fars_Province.html">Madrase-ye Khan, Shiraz </a>&#8211; I found it by chance, and it has been like discovering the Paradise entrance. You can’t enter inside the big complex but the main central hall is the most persian panorama you’ll never see: fountains, palms and tress, the sun’s reverberations on the blue majolica. No-one around (excepts a cat colony) and some nice restorers that will be happy to explain you how they are preserving the old wooden windows. Perfect. </li><li><a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293999-d6725995-Reviews-Islamic_Revolution_Holy_Defense_Museum-Tehran_Tehran_Province.html">Islamic Revolution &amp; Holy Defense Museum</a>, Teheran &#8211; Behind the propaganda grandeur (and messages), this museum is very useful to understand the long, traumatic period of the Iran-Iraq war. It’s extremely immersive, high-tech and impressive (there’s even the reconstruction, in 1:1 scale, of a bombed village in Ahvaz region). With english audio-guide, quite uncommon in Iran.</li><li>Sitting down on a carpet in an Imam Zadeh (mausoleum), but the list is quite long. The modern ones are small cities, well serviced by everything you might need, like <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/iran/yazd/attractions/imam-zadeh-jafar/a/poi-sig/1563458/361017">Imam Zadeh Jafar</a> in Yazd. The ancient ones are usually more intimate, like the really beautiful <a href="http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Emamzadeh_Soltan_Mir_Ahmad">Emamzadeh Soltan Mir Ahmad</a> in Kashan. In both cases, you’ll feel like home, and you won’t able to stand up and get out so easily (especially in summer). </li><li><a href="https://yazd.today/dolat-abad-garden/">Dolat-Abad Garden</a>, Yazd &#8211; Persian garden is a state of mind. For Iranian culture the meaning of beauty, proportions, harmony and inner light was born among fountains and trees. And you can feel it. Dolat-Abad is in the middle of an arid land, but once you enter the garden you would be able to write poems in Farsi. But you can&#8217;t, so just have an ice cream and enjoy this peaceful corner.   </li></ol>

<h2><br />And a short list of something that you&#8217;ll love so much&nbsp;</h2>



<ol><li><a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g680023-d7927664-Reviews-Puppet_Toy_Museum-Kashan_Isfahan_Province.html">Toys Museum, Kashan</a> &#8211; It&#8217;s behind a hostel, so the first time I came across I thought it was a clever way to attract new clients. But no. The museum is small and very well organized, with puppets and toys from all over Iran and the world. The girl working there is very nice and can explain to you everything about it. They organize workshops and plays for kids and the walls are covered by super interesting drawings made by some artists in residence. </li><li><a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293999-d2449554-Reviews-Jomeh_Bazaar-Tehran_Tehran_Province.html">Jomeh Bazaar</a>, Teheran &#8211; Almost 8 floors of a parking lot are there to explore. Everyone is there to sell something, and everyone is there to look around. Anything from stamp collections, pre-revolutionary memoirs, Persian carpets, clothes and jewelry are to be found. </li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_candy">Nabaat, in Farsi,</a> or sugar rocks. It is usually dipped into a black tea to make it more sweet. Typically a little bit of saffron is added, or has several herbs in it as well. There are Nabaat shops which are bigger than a supermarket, especially in Isfahan. I got mad to collect as many I could, in different colors and tastes. </li><li>Bridges, Isfahān &#8211; the perfect pattern is: one bridge, one tea, observe the people around you singing, chatting and walking &#8211; next bridge, next tea, and so on. The river is unfortunately dry, but the long promenade is still worthing. At the end you’ll be in love with the entire world (even the police that lazily monitors the situation, why not).</li></ol>



<ul class="wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img src="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Emamzadeh-Soltan-Mir-Ahmad-Kashan-1-768x1024.jpg" alt="" data-id="1687" data-link="https://irandestina.com/?attachment_id=1687" class="wp-image-1687" srcset="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Emamzadeh-Soltan-Mir-Ahmad-Kashan-1-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Emamzadeh-Soltan-Mir-Ahmad-Kashan-1-225x300.jpg 225w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Emamzadeh-Soltan-Mir-Ahmad-Kashan-1-600x800.jpg 600w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Emamzadeh-Soltan-Mir-Ahmad-Kashan-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /><figcaption>Emamzadeh Soltan Mir Ahmad, Kashan</figcaption></figure></li></ul>



<p>But the list could be more extended, of course. Above all, talk to everyone because everyone will talk to you. English is quite widespread, as well as Spanish, Italian, German, French (in Iran there are a lot of students of Japanese too). Iran has the most cultivated population in the area. Not only about poems of <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/hafez">Hafez </a>or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saadi_Shirazi">Saadi</a>. You’ll be impressed by the number of people that like talking about french cinema, jazz music, architecture, design, etc. Iranians (especially young people) knows everything of everything about the world. They are starving of experiences, interests and nice conversations. Which is not strange itself, of course. But because the 90% of the world inhabitants have a precise opinion about Iran and Iranians, which is actually completely wrong. You’ll realize it about twenty minutes after your arrival. And you’ll get lot of friends. Good suggestion: try to learn some words in Farsi, especially some jokes or funny expressions, you’ll be loved and pampered by everyone (Iranians are supposed to learn all the world languages but unfortunately no-one is supposed to learn Farsi, so a little effort in that sense could be a real challenge). Forget about everything you&#8217;re supposed to know about Iran, realty (as everywhere) is more complex than a couple of sentences on women and religion. Iranian society is incredibly diversified, and is facing a big, deep crisis that reveals how strong and ingenious it is. That&#8217;s why human contacts are the best memories you&#8217;ll keep with you from Iran.  </p>

<h2><br /><strong>Rial or Toman? which one is used in Iran?</strong></h2>



<ul class="wp-block-gallery columns-2 is-cropped"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img src="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/5000-Toman-2-982x1024.jpg" alt="" data-id="1668" data-link="https://irandestina.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-money-and-exchange-in-iran/5000-toman-3/" class="wp-image-1668" srcset="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/5000-Toman-2-982x1024.jpg 982w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/5000-Toman-2-288x300.jpg 288w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/5000-Toman-2-768x801.jpg 768w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/5000-Toman-2-600x626.jpg 600w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/5000-Toman-2.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 982px) 100vw, 982px" /></figure></li><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img src="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/10000-Toman-2-970x1024.jpg" alt="" data-id="1669" data-link="https://irandestina.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-money-and-exchange-in-iran/10000-toman-3/" class="wp-image-1669" srcset="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/10000-Toman-2-970x1024.jpg 970w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/10000-Toman-2-284x300.jpg 284w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/10000-Toman-2-768x811.jpg 768w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/10000-Toman-2-600x634.jpg 600w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/10000-Toman-2.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 970px) 100vw, 970px" /></figure></li></ul>



<p>When it comes to money in Iran, everyone gets confused. But don’t worry I will explain everything here. The official rate here is Iranian Rial(IRR), it&nbsp;means that in banks and on our bills the currency is Rial. <br /><br />In order to know <g class="gr_ gr_15 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="15" data-gr-id="15">Toman</g> you need to omit one zero from the price. For example 10,000 Rial equals 1,000 Toman. On the paper bill, you will see the Rial always, but normally local people say costs in Toman because it is easier as it has one zero less.</p>



<p><g class="gr_ gr_17 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="17" data-gr-id="17">Someties</g>&nbsp;we also make it <g class="gr_ gr_18 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="18" data-gr-id="18">easire</g> and say 1 Toman instead of 1,000 Toman. 1,000 Toman is almost the <g class="gr_ gr_19 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="19" data-gr-id="19">minumum</g> amount of products and you will usually not expect change under this amount. So you will not amounts under 1.000 Toman a lot and when we say for example 50 Toman. It means:<br /><br />50 Toman = 50,000 Toman = 500,000 Rial </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/50000-Toman-2-969x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1667" srcset="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/50000-Toman-2-969x1024.jpg 969w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/50000-Toman-2-284x300.jpg 284w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/50000-Toman-2-768x812.jpg 768w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/50000-Toman-2-600x634.jpg 600w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/50000-Toman-2.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 969px) 100vw, 969px" /></figure>



<p><br />In <g class="gr_ gr_6 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="6" data-gr-id="6">resturants</g>&nbsp;most of the time you will you see the first two type.<br />Don’t worry if you get confused, sometimes it is also confusing for us. So I think people will understand and will help you calculate or just give you time to get clear before paying.</p>



<p>Or you could easily use Iranian prepaid debit cards which makes your mind free of calculating and gives you the option to see the price of everything you buy in Rial and euro or dollar at the same time.<br /><br /></p>



<p>For better understanding of the world&#8217;s most confusing currency in Drew Binsky point of view, watch the below video.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

<h2><strong>How and where to exchange in Iran?</strong></h2>



<p>In Iran, unfortunately, you can not use your credit or debit card, there is no international bank or ATM in Iran. So you need to bring cash with you. For the exchange you go to exchange offices, you can of course exchange in the airport if it is necessary, but usually the exchange rate is not high. If you are entering Tehran, you can go to Ferdowsi square where is the place where you can find many exchange offices. Ferdowsi square is close to the city center and you can manage to visit other sightseeing parts besides exchanging your money. The prices usually fluctuates a lot and sometimes it is good to exchange at the <g class="gr_ gr_8 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="8" data-gr-id="8">begining</g> and sometimes not.</p>



<p>For checking the exchange rate you can visit <a href="https://www.bonbast.com/">https://www.bonbast.com/</a></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/rial-price-in-exchange-ofiices.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1657" srcset="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/rial-price-in-exchange-ofiices.jpg 684w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/rial-price-in-exchange-ofiices-300x65.jpg 300w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/rial-price-in-exchange-ofiices-600x130.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 684px) 100vw, 684px" /></figure>



<p>I will not suggest google because the exchange rate it suggest is not correct. <br /><br /></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/rial-price-in-google.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1656" srcset="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/rial-price-in-google.jpg 640w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/rial-price-in-google-300x134.jpg 300w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/rial-price-in-google-600x268.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></figure>



<h2><br /><strong>Can I use my credit card in Iran?</strong></h2>



<p>No, unfortunately,&nbsp;due to an embargo that the US declared on Iran trading, any international credit or debit card doesn&#8217;t work in Iran banking system. So none of your local or international bank cards will work here. That&#8217;s why you should bring all the money you will need for your trip in cash.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Is there a debit card in Iran?</strong></h2>



<p>Yes, Iranian have their own debit cards here and they can have cards, shop online, and pay on bank poses while shopping even in small shops. These cards are connected to Shetab system that is approved by the central bank. If you also want to have Iranian debit card to avoid caring your cash and shop online from Iranian websites,&nbsp; you can use our prepaid debit card.</p>

<p>        why we celebrate Sadeh festival ? Long Time ago, when the last days of summer was passing , people fill their warehouses for the hard, dark and cold winter. Winter was coming to give them frustration, illness and starvation. Therefor  darkness was sign of evil and then  light , sun and fire was sign of God’s mercy on people.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoroastrianism">Zoroastrian </a>religion Fire has a significant role. As they protect fires to burn for hundreds of years and different generation take care of an Eternal Fire inside Temples. <strong>Fire</strong> temple or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_temple">Atashkadeh </a>is a place of worship . You can visit  the <strong>fire</strong> temples in Iran  that there is an ever burning <strong>fire</strong> in them.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img src="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/fire-navid-saboori--768x1024.jpg" alt="fire " class="wp-image-1619" width="589" height="786" srcset="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/fire-navid-saboori--768x1024.jpg 768w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/fire-navid-saboori--225x300.jpg 225w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/fire-navid-saboori--600x800.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 589px) 100vw, 589px" /><figcaption>fire is the light</figcaption></figure></div>



<p></p>



<p> Since <strong>fire</strong> is a symbol of truth and light for Zoroastrians , after passing one hundred days and  nights from summer , they celebrate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadeh">Sadeh festival</a>.  So It is a celebration to remember  the importance of light, fire and energy . light which comes from God in our heart.<br /></p>



<p>So for this ceremony young teenage boys gather woods a day before festival. in other words it is kind of entering adulthood for them. such a notable ritual step toward manhood we see in all other cultures. <br /><strong> </strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/fire-joshua-newton-2-679x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1621" srcset="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/fire-joshua-newton-2-679x1024.jpg 679w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/fire-joshua-newton-2-199x300.jpg 199w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/fire-joshua-newton-2-768x1157.jpg 768w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/fire-joshua-newton-2-600x904.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 679px) 100vw, 679px" /></figure>



<p>Sade Ceremony is the hope for near spring . still 50 days remains for spring to come and bring joy and prosperity to land.<br /></p>



<p>So people wear all white clothes take their hands around the big fire . then a Zoroastrian priest  fires the bushes and together read some prayer. </p>



<p>After  the ceremony has ended the priest takes some remained fire from this big fire and take it to the fire temple and take cares of it until next year Sadeh celebration. they will use the exact fire to fire up the Next year firing. so this fire was lightening up for thousand of  years. The Eternal Fire!</p>

<p class="has-large-font-size">VISA ON ARRIVAL</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ashim-d-silva-95249-unsplash-1024x683.jpg" alt="on arrival visa" class="wp-image-1586" srcset="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ashim-d-silva-95249-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ashim-d-silva-95249-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ashim-d-silva-95249-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ashim-d-silva-95249-unsplash-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>On arrival visa</figcaption></figure>



<p>You can just get your visa on arrival in these international airports there is no visa on arrival on land borders:&nbsp;<br />(if you are crossing land borders apply for E- visa,)</p>



<ul><li>Tehran Imam Khomeini Airport</li><li>Tehran Mehrabad Airport</li><li>Shiraz Airport</li><li>Esfahan Airport</li><li>Mashad Airport</li><li>Tabriz &nbsp;Airport</li></ul>

<p>Proof of funds that you can spend in your trip. Showing cash worth around 1000 USD $ is enough.</p>



<p>You need to pay visa fee &nbsp;in cash,  only Euros or USD.</p>



<p>How much does the Iran visa costs? It is 75 Euros for all nationalities , only for Australians &nbsp;the cost is 145 Euros.&nbsp; but check it before your arrival.</p>



<p>Sometimes they don&#8217;t ask for any proof, sometimes they ask. So it is better to have those items with you in a printed paper,&nbsp;<g class="gr_ gr_6 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="6" data-gr-id="6">not</g> on phone.<br /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Do you know about Yalda?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The night of  <a href="http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/cella-term-referring-to-any-forty-day-period">Yalda</a> is the last day of fall and it is the longest night of the year in the Northern hemisphere. In Yalda night there is a special ceremony in Iran. In most parts of Iran, the extended family gather around and enjoy their time together with a lot of foods and snacks. If I could call this night with another name that would surely be the &#8220;delicious night&#8221;!</span></p>
<p><figure id="attachment_1401" style="width: 1000px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1401" src="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Yalda-watermelon.jpg" alt="Yalda watermelon" width="1000" height="666" srcset="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Yalda-watermelon.jpg 1000w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Yalda-watermelon-300x200.jpg 300w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Yalda-watermelon-768x511.jpg 768w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Yalda-watermelon-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Photo by Roman Davayposmotrim on Unsplash</figcaption></figure></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many varieties of fruits, pastry, and nuts. Everyone is talking about this night weeks before and they are deciding where to gather and what to cook. Pomegranates and watermelons are the special fruits for this time. Although the watermelons are most of the time white because of the season. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />  parents usually give newlyweds presents on this night. children are happy that they can stay awake until late at night and enjoy their time with the family and sweets!</span></p>
<h3><strong>Wait a minute!</strong></h3>
<p>After writing this blog post, I started to share it on social media, and I suddenly remembered I didn&#8217;t mention anything<br />
other than food. I obviously forget the cultural part of Yalda night, because I am so foody that I missed the most important part of this special night, reading poems!<br />
At this night we read Hafez, Khayyam, and Ferdousi poems together, we also tell our fortune with reading Hafez poems by chance and dear Hafez speak to us and advice us what to do in the future.<br />
After that, I got a really nice comment on my post which I will bring here.</p>
<blockquote><p>Yalda is the longest night of the year. Yalda is also a girls name (maybe with thick long black hair).<br />
The family gathers together, mostly at grandparents place, so they fight and survive the &#8220;darkness&#8221; together. The elderly entertain by telling stories (keep everyone busy so they forget the presence of the darkness) and feed the family with some summer fruits (saved for months in a cool place) reminding their flock of longer days ahead.<br />
We Iranians celebrate by constantly using our profound symbols of life and creation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Okay, now I feel much better, but I will definitely add more things on this blog as soon as I remember or if any of you remind me more traditions for this wonderful night!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tajrish Bazaar is located at the north side of Tehran in Shemiranat County, near northern hills and Imamzadeh Saleh. In the past Shemiranat was apart from the urban part. Because of the mountains, the temperature in Tajrish square is lower than other parts of Tehran and in summer you can enjoy the weather. Tajrish bazaar is a small sample of Tehran bazaar and you can spend at least a day in this area.</span></p>
<p><figure id="attachment_1373" style="width: 1200px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1373" src="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Tajrish-Bazaar-4.jpg" alt="Tajrish Bazaar" width="1200" height="800" srcset="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Tajrish-Bazaar-4.jpg 1200w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Tajrish-Bazaar-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Tajrish-Bazaar-4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Tajrish-Bazaar-4-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Tajrish-Bazaar-4-600x400.jpg 600w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Tajrish-Bazaar-4-720x480.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Tajrish Bazaar</figcaption></figure></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I personally like Tajrish and the bazaar because of its atmosphere. The bazaar consists of a vegetable market that has a great vibe and it is colorful. Everyone is looking for something and sometimes you stuck in people traffic. Local people really like this place and people from all over Tehran go there to shop or just enjoy the colorful shops.</span></p>
<p><figure id="attachment_1370" style="width: 1200px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1370" src="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Tajrish-Bazaar-1.jpg" alt="Tajrish Bazaar" width="1200" height="800" srcset="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Tajrish-Bazaar-1.jpg 1200w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Tajrish-Bazaar-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Tajrish-Bazaar-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Tajrish-Bazaar-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Tajrish-Bazaar-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Colorful vegtables</figcaption></figure></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whenever I go there I should buy something, I cannot resist the smell and image. You hear sellers trying to advertise their products and they smile at you. There is almost everything in the Bazaar and you will not come back home without finding what you need.</span></p>
<p><figure id="attachment_1375" style="width: 1200px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1375" src="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Tajrish-Bazaar-6.jpg" alt="Tajrish Bazaar" width="1200" height="800" srcset="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Tajrish-Bazaar-6.jpg 1200w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Tajrish-Bazaar-6-300x200.jpg 300w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Tajrish-Bazaar-6-768x512.jpg 768w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Tajrish-Bazaar-6-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Tajrish-Bazaar-6-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Homemade olive pickles</figcaption></figure></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For tourists and photographers, it is a nice place to shoot photos, especially in the early morning, both because of the light and because it is less crowded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can spend at least one day in this area, there is also lots of attractions nearby. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like:</span></p>

<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imamzadeh Saleh</span></li>

</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tajrish bazaar is close to Tajrish metro station and you can reach there easily.</span></li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Bam, you can go on a Date in a special Date during a year and eat Dates That are produced in Bam. I don&#8217;t know why English lacks words, just kidding:))) for your Information I should say the quality of Dates from Bam is so good that it is mostly exported out of Iran. they are named “Mazafati Date”.</p>

<p>The beautiful Palm trees that make them are around the Arg-e Bam oasis that are on the World Heritage list you can find more information on <a href="https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1208">Unesco,</a> this heritage is called “Bam and its Cultural Landscape.</p>

<p>What are Arg-e Bam special features:</p>
<p>fortified medieval town<br />
built in vernacular technique using mud layers (Chineh)<br />
being in the crossroads of important trade routes( silk road)<br />
known for the production of silk and cotton clothing<br />
underground irrigation canals (called “qanāts”)</p>

<p>Beside archaeological values, you may remember Bam for the devastating earthquake happened in 2003, unfortunately, 26,200 people died in that disaster. Hopefully, Bam has been rebuilt. So it’s IranDestina’s recommendation to visit this medieval town and its green landscape, ring of Palm trees in heart of the desert.</p>
