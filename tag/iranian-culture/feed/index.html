<p>I think my experience in <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/iran">Iran </a>has been slightly different from that of a traveller, as I went there for a course of Persian at <a href="https://icps.ut.ac.ir/index-e.html">Dehkhoda Institute</a>.</p>



<p>I spent forty days there, and I have stayed primarily in <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/iran/tehran">Tehran</a>, where the Institute was. I only traveled to Shiraz for a weekend and to <a href="https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Sari">Sari </a>(in the North, near the<a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Caspian-Sea"> Caspian se</a>a) for another weekend. I had been in Iran before and I had back then visited Esfahan too.</p>



<p>Well, let me start with <a href="https://wikitravel.org/en/Isfahan">Esfahan</a>. They call the city “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isfahan">nesf-e jahan</a>”, half of the world, which in itself is not very surprising, if you think that there are many cities around the world where proud inhabitants make up phrases and expressions to promote the beauty and the unicity of the city itself (think about <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Naples">Naples, “vedi Napoli e poi muori</a>” or <a href="https://es.wikiquote.org/wiki/Granada">Granada</a>, “has llegado a Granada, lo mejor del mundo entero”). Well, I have to admit that few things I saw had on me the effect of seeing Naqsh-e Jahan Square in Esfahan. And not only the square makes you feel like you would like to spend some more time or even some years in that city, but also the streets full of young families having picnics everywhere you see grass, or the men sitting under <a href="http://www.bridgesdb.com/bridge-list/siosepol-bridge/">si-o se pol</a>, singing forbidden songs, promptly interrupted by the guards, when a too big crowd gathers to listen.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img src="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Azadi-Tower-683x1024.jpg" alt="" data-id="1727" data-link="https://irandestina.com/?attachment_id=1727" class="wp-image-1727" srcset="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Azadi-Tower-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Azadi-Tower-200x300.jpg 200w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Azadi-Tower-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Azadi-Tower-600x900.jpg 600w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Azadi-Tower.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" /><figcaption>Tehran</figcaption></figure></li></ul>



<p>Admittedly, going back to Tehran, having spent some days in cities like Esfahan or <a href="https://wikitravel.org/en/Shiraz">Shiraz</a>, is a pure nightmare: the city is pregnant with smog, pollution, heavy air that makes you feel tired only after walking a kilometer on your feet, if you have survived to cross the streets in the middle of the busiest traffic you can imagine. But Tehran is unfortunately the heart of Iran, the political thermometer, the city where everything is possible: seeing a woman moving around with her headscarf fallen off her head, high heels and very very tight clothes, that don’t leave much to imagination, and seeing another one all covered up in her black chador, the two walking together hand in hand. Hidden house parties where as soon as you arrive, everyone goes to take off the many layers of clothes they were wearing on the streets and hurries to get drunk, and religious processions where believers flog themselves to the point of bleeding.</p>



<p>I see Iran as a country of paradox, a mixture of ancestral <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoroastrians_in_Iran">Zoroastrian</a> culture, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_Iran">Islamic </a>culture, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_culture">western culture,</a> <g class="gr_ gr_21 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="21" data-gr-id="21">and</g> <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/autochthonous">autochthonous </a>Iranian modern culture.</p>



<p>And books: books are everywhere, books are scattered down on the pavement, on the piece of cloth where they are exposed by the street seller; books are staying orderly inside a book machine dispenser; books in the small <a href="https://theculturetrip.com/middle-east/iran/articles/the-6-best-bookshops-in-tehran-you-should-visit/">library in Enghelab</a> street where they organize weekly discussions about literature; books are in the hands of the women who fill the metro during pick hours in Tehran; books are everywhere. Poetry is everywhere too: in the speech of the taxi driver, in the song coming from the radio, in the recommendation of the grandmother while you are leaving her house, after helping her wash the dishes; in the air at the <a href="https://www.destinationiran.com/visit-mausoleum-of-hafez-the-persian-poet-in-shiraz.htm">mausoleum of Hafez</a> in Shiraz, crowded at whichever time you visit it, with people from all over the country.</p>



<p>Iran is the Persian teacher who will tell you more about the history of your own country than yourself have ever known. Iran is the incredible corners that open up unexpectedly while you are walking on the most common-looking street of Shiraz or Tehran, it’s the <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293999-d15139619-Reviews-Baccara_Cafe-Tehran_Tehran_Province.html">small café</a> where you sit in an exquisite patio with a fountain in the middle and flowers all around. It’s Harry Potter café in Tehran, with the very young waitress who jumps up and down out of joy because she could exchange some French words with you; it’s Parvaneh market in Tehran, where all wishes come true, and all you ever wanted to buy is there, if you look closely and spend your morning going around its five floors. Iran is seeing a man walking his dog around with pride, in spite of the ban on possessing dogs, as they are supposedly haram.</p>



<p>Iran is many things, many people, and a huge country of which I only lived a small part, but where you will realise that, to say it with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_Angelou">Maya Angelou</a>, “we are more alike, my friends, than we are unalike”.</p>

<p>        why we celebrate Sadeh festival ? Long Time ago, when the last days of summer was passing , people fill their warehouses for the hard, dark and cold winter. Winter was coming to give them frustration, illness and starvation. Therefor  darkness was sign of evil and then  light , sun and fire was sign of God’s mercy on people.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoroastrianism">Zoroastrian </a>religion Fire has a significant role. As they protect fires to burn for hundreds of years and different generation take care of an Eternal Fire inside Temples. <strong>Fire</strong> temple or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_temple">Atashkadeh </a>is a place of worship . You can visit  the <strong>fire</strong> temples in Iran  that there is an ever burning <strong>fire</strong> in them.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img src="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/fire-navid-saboori--768x1024.jpg" alt="fire " class="wp-image-1619" width="589" height="786" srcset="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/fire-navid-saboori--768x1024.jpg 768w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/fire-navid-saboori--225x300.jpg 225w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/fire-navid-saboori--600x800.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 589px) 100vw, 589px" /><figcaption>fire is the light</figcaption></figure></div>



<p></p>



<p> Since <strong>fire</strong> is a symbol of truth and light for Zoroastrians , after passing one hundred days and  nights from summer , they celebrate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadeh">Sadeh festival</a>.  So It is a celebration to remember  the importance of light, fire and energy . light which comes from God in our heart.<br /></p>



<p>So for this ceremony young teenage boys gather woods a day before festival. in other words it is kind of entering adulthood for them. such a notable ritual step toward manhood we see in all other cultures. <br /><strong> </strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/fire-joshua-newton-2-679x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1621" srcset="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/fire-joshua-newton-2-679x1024.jpg 679w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/fire-joshua-newton-2-199x300.jpg 199w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/fire-joshua-newton-2-768x1157.jpg 768w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/fire-joshua-newton-2-600x904.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 679px) 100vw, 679px" /></figure>



<p>Sade Ceremony is the hope for near spring . still 50 days remains for spring to come and bring joy and prosperity to land.<br /></p>



<p>So people wear all white clothes take their hands around the big fire . then a Zoroastrian priest  fires the bushes and together read some prayer. </p>



<p>After  the ceremony has ended the priest takes some remained fire from this big fire and take it to the fire temple and take cares of it until next year Sadeh celebration. they will use the exact fire to fire up the Next year firing. so this fire was lightening up for thousand of  years. The Eternal Fire!</p>
