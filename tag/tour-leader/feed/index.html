<p> I am a Tour Guide. I have led a lot of group tours over the past 7 years. I always believed that a tour guide is a teacher, but a trip teacher. Traveling alongside people with a lot of personalities is interesting for me. People of different ages with different abilities to endure travel difficulties. About 2 years ago, when I realized that I am pregnant,  I had to change <a href="https://irandestina.com/maryams-story/">my lifestyle</a>, so abandon tour guiding. It is a job that quickly disappears from daily activities.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kharanaq-5-4.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1650" srcset="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kharanaq-5-4.jpg 1000w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kharanaq-5-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kharanaq-5-4-768x511.jpg 768w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kharanaq-5-4-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure>



<p>In the past two years, I&#8217;ve traveled less than my previous life. Whether pregnancy or breastfeeding, and afterwards, it is not easy to travel with an infant. </p>



<p>About a month ago, I decided to break this period when my husband suggested traveling to <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/iran/kharanaq">Kharanaq</a>. 10 years ago, my husband and I met each other in <a href="https://en.unesco.org/silkroad/photo-bank/kharanaq-caravanserai">Kharanq Caravanserai</a>. He suggested celebrating the 10th anniversary in the same place. It was not easy for me. stepping with a 14-month-old son in this way, I thought it was madness. At first, I did not accept that, but later, with the support of two of my friends (<a href="https://irandestina.com/parastoos-story/">Parastoo </a>and <a href="https://irandestina.com/shamims-story/">Shamim </a>who work together these days), I accepted. So we planned a 3.5-days trip to Kharandagh, a village in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yazd_Province">Yazd province</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kharanaq-2-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1639" srcset="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kharanaq-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kharanaq-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kharanaq-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kharanaq-2-600x400.jpg 600w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kharanaq-2.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Coordination began. After each phone-call I took for the trip, I had to feed my son or help him for sleeping or clean him. My friends and husband took some responsibility to help me. When the train ticket was opened on the railroad site, I had to buy it quickly, because it could be all reserved and we could lose&nbsp;the train. We all did it in the space where the child was crying. We must had written 35 names and 35 families and 35 national codes without the slightest error. Eventually, the tickets were purchased.</p>



<p>At nights, I was dreaming the nightmare that I lost the train, and the passengers, with the guidance of my 14-month-old son, started the trip. I provided a list of what to do and checked it many times each day.</p>



<p><a href="https://irandestina.com/parastoos-story/">Parastoo</a>, <a href="https://irandestina.com/shamims-story/">Shamim</a>, my husband and I, managed the tour during the trip. A tour of 35 people between 14 months to 70 years old. There were 3 other children on the tour, beside my son.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Maryam-and-Shamim-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1641" srcset="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Maryam-and-Shamim-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Maryam-and-Shamim-300x200.jpg 300w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Maryam-and-Shamim-768x512.jpg 768w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Maryam-and-Shamim-600x400.jpg 600w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Maryam-and-Shamim.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>I didn&#8217;t sleep the night before the trip for various reasons. We were in the railway at 4 am before the rest. Everyone got together and the besides started. My child was sleeping in the carriage. One side of my mind was occupied by the guard for the ticket, another place to count all the passengers and at the same time worried about losing the carriage in the crowd.</p>



<p>When we arrived in Yazd, we were in charge of picking up passengers and riding a bus. I still was worried about losing the carriage. When I arrived at the Shah Abbasi Caravanserai, where we were supposed to spend 2 nights. I was responsible for setting the dinner, breakfast, the cold temperature of the rooms, the health of the passengers, along with a crying child who and couldn&#8217;t sleep and eat. To the end, I was sure I would not see the morning.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kharanaq-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1643" srcset="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kharanaq-1.jpg 992w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kharanaq-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kharanaq-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kharanaq-1-600x450.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 992px) 100vw, 992px" /></figure>



<p>But I saw the morning, and we drove into the desert with travelers who were better than my imagination. The storm of sand in the desert and the destruction of one of the cars, along with the fear of damaging the child&#8217;s lungs, changed my mood again. The night we were all around the caravanserai, I felt calm.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kharanaq-3-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1642" srcset="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kharanaq-3-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kharanaq-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kharanaq-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kharanaq-3-600x400.jpg 600w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kharanaq-3.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The last day of the trip, visiting Meybod and Ardakan and <g class="gr_ gr_73 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep" id="73" data-gr-id="73">Yazd,</g> made the trip a bit heavy. At all these times costs should be calculated, we set hours to do so, and each time we should count passengers. At 8 o&#8217;clock we boarded the train. I felt like I was in a race and now is near the finish line. I counted <g class="gr_ gr_9 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling multiReplace" id="9" data-gr-id="9">everyone</g>. I put the baby carriage in front of me and slept with the train shuffles.</p>



<p>In the morning, when we all came to Tehran with smile, I had a dual sense. Whether I have achieved success or went under the risk of stupidity? I still do not know. I don&#8217;t even know shall I advise anyone or not. Anyway, my friends, my husband and I did it all together.<br /></p>
