<p>I traveled to <a href="https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Qazvin">Qazvin </a>a while ago. Not because I chose Qazvin, just because Tehran&#8217;s air was very polluted and we left the city to get rid of it. Again, our goal was not to travel to Qazvin, according to the habit of people in Tehran, we rode on the <a href="https://irandoostan.com/chaloos-the-most-beautiful-road-in-iran/">Chalous road</a>, which kept us from continuing the path to the long traffic lane of the road. So we turned away and turned to <a href="https://wikitravel.org/en/Karaj">Karaj</a>. We hopelessly checked out the available facilities to retreat back home. <g class="gr_ gr_11 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="11" data-gr-id="11">Eventually</g> we decided to go to Qazvin. We were not very optimistic about the choice, but there was no other option. On the way, thanks to the Internet, we went looking for a few hotels and eventually contacting one of the traditional hotels, <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.co.za/Hotel_Review-g680026-d11663937-Reviews-Traditional_Behrouzi_Hotel-Qazvin_Qazvin_Province.html">traditional Behrouzi hotel</a>.</p>



<p>I do not know how many times I&#8217;ve been to Qazvin province. I even traveled to the surrounding villages and nature of the province, once I stopped at my friend’s student Dormitory one night in Qazvin, but I never looked at Qazvin as a tourist destination.</p>



<p>This time it was important from the moment of my arrival to the city. Wide streets that have made it easy to get a positive feel to the traveler. The city was alive and, despite the heavy rains, people were in the streets.</p>



<p>We followed the map to get to the hotel location. A hotel in a traditional home in the city of Qazvin. In our path I saw the old bazaar. The excitement took me all the way, so after chek-in, we immediately went out. The rain was heavy. The S<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caravanserai_of_Sa%27d_al-Saltaneh">adosaltaneh Caravanserai </a>was the first place to go. The beauty of restoration and maintenance was beyond my imagination. Cafes were located there and helped experience a good sense of eating and drinking in the old space. We stayed a bit there and then returned to the hotel for a break.</p>



<p>The next day, we left the hotel to visit the bazaar, <a href="http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/cehel-sotun-qazvin-a-safavid-pavilion-that-stands-amid-gardens-in-the-central-meydan-square-of-the-old-city-and-in-w">Chehel Sotun</a>, <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/iran/qazvin/attractions/ali-qapu/a/poi-sig/1121005/361035">Aliqapu</a>, <a href="http://destription.com/en/iran/attraction/safavi-gardens-collection">Safavi Garden complex</a>, Naderi mansion, Mirza Karim bath, Barajin Tower and &#8230;. Every moment that I touched the sights of Qazvin, and every time I looked at people&#8217;s life, the question came to me about why I have never visited Qazvin so far? It was not only strange to me, my husband had the same experience. We have been passing over from Qazvin many times and we have never been to this city full of spectacular places.</p>



<p>Has not Qazvin been the capital of the Safavids before <a href="https://en.unesco.org/silkroad/content/isfahan">Isfahan</a>? Is not that what we have in Isfahan,its primary sample is in Qazvin? Was not the  first modern Iranian street in Qazvin? So why Isfahan is half the world and Qazvin is just a city between the way?</p>



<p>I do not know if the proximity of this city to Tehran has exacerbated its beauty and majesty, or the people there, &nbsp;themselves are not interested in attracting tourists too much.This unawareness of a beautiful city and close to capital of Iran make me think about how many other places in Iran I have just gone through? </p>



<p>My trip to Qazvin was less than two days. After returning every moment I think about there and look forward to a trip again, this time with planning and for a longer time to this city. Qazvin should not be lost.<br /></p>

<p>        why we celebrate Sadeh festival ? Long Time ago, when the last days of summer was passing , people fill their warehouses for the hard, dark and cold winter. Winter was coming to give them frustration, illness and starvation. Therefor  darkness was sign of evil and then  light , sun and fire was sign of God’s mercy on people.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoroastrianism">Zoroastrian </a>religion Fire has a significant role. As they protect fires to burn for hundreds of years and different generation take care of an Eternal Fire inside Temples. <strong>Fire</strong> temple or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_temple">Atashkadeh </a>is a place of worship . You can visit  the <strong>fire</strong> temples in Iran  that there is an ever burning <strong>fire</strong> in them.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img src="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/fire-navid-saboori--768x1024.jpg" alt="fire " class="wp-image-1619" width="589" height="786" srcset="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/fire-navid-saboori--768x1024.jpg 768w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/fire-navid-saboori--225x300.jpg 225w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/fire-navid-saboori--600x800.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 589px) 100vw, 589px" /><figcaption>fire is the light</figcaption></figure></div>



<p></p>



<p> Since <strong>fire</strong> is a symbol of truth and light for Zoroastrians , after passing one hundred days and  nights from summer , they celebrate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadeh">Sadeh festival</a>.  So It is a celebration to remember  the importance of light, fire and energy . light which comes from God in our heart.<br /></p>



<p>So for this ceremony young teenage boys gather woods a day before festival. in other words it is kind of entering adulthood for them. such a notable ritual step toward manhood we see in all other cultures. <br /><strong> </strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/fire-joshua-newton-2-679x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1621" srcset="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/fire-joshua-newton-2-679x1024.jpg 679w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/fire-joshua-newton-2-199x300.jpg 199w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/fire-joshua-newton-2-768x1157.jpg 768w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/fire-joshua-newton-2-600x904.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 679px) 100vw, 679px" /></figure>



<p>Sade Ceremony is the hope for near spring . still 50 days remains for spring to come and bring joy and prosperity to land.<br /></p>



<p>So people wear all white clothes take their hands around the big fire . then a Zoroastrian priest  fires the bushes and together read some prayer. </p>



<p>After  the ceremony has ended the priest takes some remained fire from this big fire and take it to the fire temple and take cares of it until next year Sadeh celebration. they will use the exact fire to fire up the Next year firing. so this fire was lightening up for thousand of  years. The Eternal Fire!</p>

<p></p>



<p> I am a Tour Guide. I have led a lot of group tours over the past 7 years. I always believed that a tour guide is a teacher, but a trip teacher. Traveling alongside people with a lot of personalities is interesting for me. People of different ages with different abilities to endure travel difficulties. About 2 years ago, when I realized that I am pregnant,  I had to change <a href="https://irandestina.com/maryams-story/">my lifestyle</a>, so abandon tour guiding. It is a job that quickly disappears from daily activities.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kharanaq-5-4.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1650" srcset="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kharanaq-5-4.jpg 1000w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kharanaq-5-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kharanaq-5-4-768x511.jpg 768w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kharanaq-5-4-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure>



<p>In the past two years, I&#8217;ve traveled less than my previous life. Whether pregnancy or breastfeeding, and afterwards, it is not easy to travel with an infant. </p>



<p>About a month ago, I decided to break this period when my husband suggested traveling to <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/iran/kharanaq">Kharanaq</a>. 10 years ago, my husband and I met each other in <a href="https://en.unesco.org/silkroad/photo-bank/kharanaq-caravanserai">Kharanq Caravanserai</a>. He suggested celebrating the 10th anniversary in the same place. It was not easy for me. stepping with a 14-month-old son in this way, I thought it was madness. At first, I did not accept that, but later, with the support of two of my friends (<a href="https://irandestina.com/parastoos-story/">Parastoo </a>and <a href="https://irandestina.com/shamims-story/">Shamim </a>who work together these days), I accepted. So we planned a 3.5-days trip to Kharandagh, a village in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yazd_Province">Yazd province</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kharanaq-2-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1639" srcset="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kharanaq-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kharanaq-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kharanaq-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kharanaq-2-600x400.jpg 600w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kharanaq-2.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Coordination began. After each phone-call I took for the trip, I had to feed my son or help him for sleeping or clean him. My friends and husband took some responsibility to help me. When the train ticket was opened on the railroad site, I had to buy it quickly, because it could be all reserved and we could lose&nbsp;the train. We all did it in the space where the child was crying. We must had written 35 names and 35 families and 35 national codes without the slightest error. Eventually, the tickets were purchased.</p>



<p>At nights, I was dreaming the nightmare that I lost the train, and the passengers, with the guidance of my 14-month-old son, started the trip. I provided a list of what to do and checked it many times each day.</p>



<p><a href="https://irandestina.com/parastoos-story/">Parastoo</a>, <a href="https://irandestina.com/shamims-story/">Shamim</a>, my husband and I, managed the tour during the trip. A tour of 35 people between 14 months to 70 years old. There were 3 other children on the tour, beside my son.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Maryam-and-Shamim-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1641" srcset="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Maryam-and-Shamim-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Maryam-and-Shamim-300x200.jpg 300w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Maryam-and-Shamim-768x512.jpg 768w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Maryam-and-Shamim-600x400.jpg 600w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Maryam-and-Shamim.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>I didn&#8217;t sleep the night before the trip for various reasons. We were in the railway at 4 am before the rest. Everyone got together and the besides started. My child was sleeping in the carriage. One side of my mind was occupied by the guard for the ticket, another place to count all the passengers and at the same time worried about losing the carriage in the crowd.</p>



<p>When we arrived in Yazd, we were in charge of picking up passengers and riding a bus. I still was worried about losing the carriage. When I arrived at the Shah Abbasi Caravanserai, where we were supposed to spend 2 nights. I was responsible for setting the dinner, breakfast, the cold temperature of the rooms, the health of the passengers, along with a crying child who and couldn&#8217;t sleep and eat. To the end, I was sure I would not see the morning.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kharanaq-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1643" srcset="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kharanaq-1.jpg 992w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kharanaq-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kharanaq-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kharanaq-1-600x450.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 992px) 100vw, 992px" /></figure>



<p>But I saw the morning, and we drove into the desert with travelers who were better than my imagination. The storm of sand in the desert and the destruction of one of the cars, along with the fear of damaging the child&#8217;s lungs, changed my mood again. The night we were all around the caravanserai, I felt calm.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kharanaq-3-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1642" srcset="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kharanaq-3-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kharanaq-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kharanaq-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kharanaq-3-600x400.jpg 600w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kharanaq-3.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The last day of the trip, visiting Meybod and Ardakan and <g class="gr_ gr_73 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep" id="73" data-gr-id="73">Yazd,</g> made the trip a bit heavy. At all these times costs should be calculated, we set hours to do so, and each time we should count passengers. At 8 o&#8217;clock we boarded the train. I felt like I was in a race and now is near the finish line. I counted <g class="gr_ gr_9 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling multiReplace" id="9" data-gr-id="9">everyone</g>. I put the baby carriage in front of me and slept with the train shuffles.</p>



<p>In the morning, when we all came to Tehran with smile, I had a dual sense. Whether I have achieved success or went under the risk of stupidity? I still do not know. I don&#8217;t even know shall I advise anyone or not. Anyway, my friends, my husband and I did it all together.<br /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Do you know about Yalda?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The night of  <a href="http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/cella-term-referring-to-any-forty-day-period">Yalda</a> is the last day of fall and it is the longest night of the year in the Northern hemisphere. In Yalda night there is a special ceremony in Iran. In most parts of Iran, the extended family gather around and enjoy their time together with a lot of foods and snacks. If I could call this night with another name that would surely be the &#8220;delicious night&#8221;!</span></p>
<p><figure id="attachment_1401" style="width: 1000px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1401" src="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Yalda-watermelon.jpg" alt="Yalda watermelon" width="1000" height="666" srcset="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Yalda-watermelon.jpg 1000w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Yalda-watermelon-300x200.jpg 300w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Yalda-watermelon-768x511.jpg 768w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Yalda-watermelon-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Photo by Roman Davayposmotrim on Unsplash</figcaption></figure></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many varieties of fruits, pastry, and nuts. Everyone is talking about this night weeks before and they are deciding where to gather and what to cook. Pomegranates and watermelons are the special fruits for this time. Although the watermelons are most of the time white because of the season. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />  parents usually give newlyweds presents on this night. children are happy that they can stay awake until late at night and enjoy their time with the family and sweets!</span></p>
<h3><strong>Wait a minute!</strong></h3>
<p>After writing this blog post, I started to share it on social media, and I suddenly remembered I didn&#8217;t mention anything<br />
other than food. I obviously forget the cultural part of Yalda night, because I am so foody that I missed the most important part of this special night, reading poems!<br />
At this night we read Hafez, Khayyam, and Ferdousi poems together, we also tell our fortune with reading Hafez poems by chance and dear Hafez speak to us and advice us what to do in the future.<br />
After that, I got a really nice comment on my post which I will bring here.</p>
<blockquote><p>Yalda is the longest night of the year. Yalda is also a girls name (maybe with thick long black hair).<br />
The family gathers together, mostly at grandparents place, so they fight and survive the &#8220;darkness&#8221; together. The elderly entertain by telling stories (keep everyone busy so they forget the presence of the darkness) and feed the family with some summer fruits (saved for months in a cool place) reminding their flock of longer days ahead.<br />
We Iranians celebrate by constantly using our profound symbols of life and creation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Okay, now I feel much better, but I will definitely add more things on this blog as soon as I remember or if any of you remind me more traditions for this wonderful night!</p>
<h2><strong>Do you want to celebrate Yalda with us?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, <a href="https://irandestina.com/about/">Irandestina</a> group as a tourism event organizer invites all travelers who are in Tehran to celebrate Yalda night together. This ceremony will be held in <a href="https://www.instagram.com/baccara_cafe/">Baccara Cafe</a> with one of the most creative team and local food and beverages. We celebrate Yalda in Baccara Cafe for happiness, poetry, live Persian traditional music, Yalda snacks, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_theatre#Siah-Bazi">Siah Bazi performance</a>, etc.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tajrish Bazaar is located at the north side of Tehran in Shemiranat County, near northern hills and Imamzadeh Saleh. In the past Shemiranat was apart from the urban part. Because of the mountains, the temperature in Tajrish square is lower than other parts of Tehran and in summer you can enjoy the weather. Tajrish bazaar is a small sample of Tehran bazaar and you can spend at least a day in this area.</span></p>
<p><figure id="attachment_1373" style="width: 1200px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1373" src="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Tajrish-Bazaar-4.jpg" alt="Tajrish Bazaar" width="1200" height="800" srcset="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Tajrish-Bazaar-4.jpg 1200w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Tajrish-Bazaar-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Tajrish-Bazaar-4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Tajrish-Bazaar-4-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Tajrish-Bazaar-4-600x400.jpg 600w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Tajrish-Bazaar-4-720x480.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Tajrish Bazaar</figcaption></figure></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I personally like Tajrish and the bazaar because of its atmosphere. The bazaar consists of a vegetable market that has a great vibe and it is colorful. Everyone is looking for something and sometimes you stuck in people traffic. Local people really like this place and people from all over Tehran go there to shop or just enjoy the colorful shops.</span></p>
<p><figure id="attachment_1370" style="width: 1200px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1370" src="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Tajrish-Bazaar-1.jpg" alt="Tajrish Bazaar" width="1200" height="800" srcset="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Tajrish-Bazaar-1.jpg 1200w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Tajrish-Bazaar-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Tajrish-Bazaar-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Tajrish-Bazaar-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Tajrish-Bazaar-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Colorful vegtables</figcaption></figure></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whenever I go there I should buy something, I cannot resist the smell and image. You hear sellers trying to advertise their products and they smile at you. There is almost everything in the Bazaar and you will not come back home without finding what you need.</span></p>
<p><figure id="attachment_1375" style="width: 1200px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1375" src="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Tajrish-Bazaar-6.jpg" alt="Tajrish Bazaar" width="1200" height="800" srcset="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Tajrish-Bazaar-6.jpg 1200w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Tajrish-Bazaar-6-300x200.jpg 300w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Tajrish-Bazaar-6-768x512.jpg 768w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Tajrish-Bazaar-6-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Tajrish-Bazaar-6-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Homemade olive pickles</figcaption></figure></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For tourists and photographers, it is a nice place to shoot photos, especially in the early morning, both because of the light and because it is less crowded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can spend at least one day in this area, there is also lots of attractions nearby. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imamzadeh Saleh</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Darband mountains and village</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saad abad palace</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Niavaran palace</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Bam, you can go on a Date in a special Date during a year and eat Dates That are produced in Bam. I don&#8217;t know why English lacks words, just kidding:))) for your Information I should say the quality of Dates from Bam is so good that it is mostly exported out of Iran. they are named “Mazafati Date”.</p>

<p>The beautiful Palm trees that make them are around the Arg-e Bam oasis that are on the World Heritage list you can find more information on <a href="https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1208">Unesco,</a> this heritage is called “Bam and its Cultural Landscape.</p>

<p>What are Arg-e Bam special features:</p>
<p>fortified medieval town<br />
built in vernacular technique using mud layers (Chineh)<br />
being in the crossroads of important trade routes( silk road)<br />
known for the production of silk and cotton clothing<br />
underground irrigation canals (called “qanāts”)</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_1362" style="width: 1080px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1362" src="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Bam-city-Iran.jpg" alt="Arg e Bam" width="1080" height="1812" srcset="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Bam-city-Iran.jpg 1080w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Bam-city-Iran-179x300.jpg 179w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Bam-city-Iran-768x1289.jpg 768w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Bam-city-Iran-610x1024.jpg 610w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Bam-city-Iran-600x1007.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Arg e Bam</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Beside archaeological values, you may remember Bam for the devastating earthquake happened in 2003, unfortunately, 26,200 people died in that disaster. Hopefully, Bam has been rebuilt. So it’s IranDestina’s recommendation to visit this medieval town and its green landscape, ring of Palm trees in heart of the desert.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everything began with the wishes of my childhood. That&#8217;s when I decided to be a travel writer. I wished to travel and write about unknowns, different lives, different cultures, and diverse nature. As I grew up, many of these aspirations were lost during the days.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1424" src="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Meramous.jpg" alt="Maryam Mousavi" width="1000" height="1500" srcset="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Meramous.jpg 1000w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Meramous-200x300.jpg 200w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Meramous-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Meramous-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Meramous-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I did not become a writer then I studied at the Bachelor of Engineering in Chemistry. For years I worked at the insurance company, cinema, newspapers, and magazines, but I never had the full satisfaction. In 2009, I met a man who marries me three years later. We have a 1-year old son. My husband helped me determine my career path further. He advised me to see the journey professionally.</span></p>
<p><figure id="attachment_1422" style="width: 1000px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1422" src="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MeraGood-Damavand.jpg" alt="MeraGood Damavand" width="1000" height="666" srcset="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MeraGood-Damavand.jpg 1000w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MeraGood-Damavand-300x200.jpg 300w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MeraGood-Damavand-768x511.jpg 768w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MeraGood-Damavand-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Our Family</figcaption></figure></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> After that, I became a cultural and natural tour leader. I studied Master of tourism management. Then I met my traveler friends in university who are my colleagues today. In these years I have searched in the tourism industry and see what I like most. I chose sustainable tourism development. I work voluntarily and non-voluntarily in various activities in this field. It is pleasant for me to be active in any field of tourism that boosts local communities&#8217; economic, environmental, peace and friendship and any positive developments in the world. Tourism is a way for me to make my dreams true.<br />

</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Today I am a traveler mom. We started traveling with my husband since my son was only 50 days old. This way will continue. Irandestina is a way for me to achieve all this journey and experience and peace together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">P.S. My child&#8217;s name is “Damavand”. <a href="https://irandestina.com/three-giant-monsters-mountains-in-iran/">Damavand</a> is the highest peak in Iran.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi, My name is Shamim!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Shamim means Scent of a flower. It has been more than a quarter century living in this area called “the earth”. I am happy that I know how to take life easy, so I can go on a trip in less than an hour. In my experience, unplanned trips lead to be the most awesome trip ever in your life. So I grab these kinds of opportunities.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1344" src="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Shamim-Ataei.jpg" alt="" width="2448" height="3264" srcset="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Shamim-Ataei.jpg 2448w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Shamim-Ataei-225x300.jpg 225w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Shamim-Ataei-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Shamim-Ataei-600x800.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2448px) 100vw, 2448px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beside personal attitudes toward the universe, I think traveling is the best way to maintain peace among countries because in our limited perspective provided by media we think we are superior or different from other nations but when we travel we find only similarities, we find love and passion, culture and art. so that is the most sustainable way to travel to different countries, to understand the world deeper.</span></p>
<p><figure id="attachment_1342" style="width: 6000px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1342" src="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Babak-Castle.jpg" alt="Babak Castle" width="6000" height="4000" srcset="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Babak-Castle.jpg 6000w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Babak-Castle-300x200.jpg 300w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Babak-Castle-768x512.jpg 768w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Babak-Castle-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Babak-Castle-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 6000px) 100vw, 6000px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Babak Castle &#8211; Kaleybar  photo: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cherishka/">@Cherishka</a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IranDestina fulfills my thirst to help Travelers (for me they are adventurers) who travel to Iran, one of the most hospitable places on the earth, to visit Persian empire heritages and to meet Iranian Islamic Art, culture and most important meet people and make unforgettable memories. It is my personal invitation, only let me know how can I help to make your visit happen. I will show you around, or only answer your questions….</span></p>

<p>Cave in Hormoz Island</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was the last child in my family and because of that all of my siblings took me with them in their trips in Iran and that’s when my desire to travel started. I visited all of provinces is Iran and I learned a lot of things while traveling. Every city and village in Iran has its own culture and that helped me to be more open-minded and grow in my life.</span></p>
<p><figure id="attachment_1261" style="width: 748px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-1261" src="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Imam-Square-Isfahan-1024x615.jpg" alt="Isfahan - Imam square" width="748" height="449" srcset="https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Imam-Square-Isfahan-1024x615.jpg 1024w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Imam-Square-Isfahan-300x180.jpg 300w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Imam-Square-Isfahan-768x461.jpg 768w, https://irandestina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Imam-Square-Isfahan-600x360.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 748px) 100vw, 748px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Isfahan &#8211; Imam square</figcaption></figure></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I wanted to know more and I decided to learn English to be able to communicate with the world and learn from other people. That was not enough I could only read about other countries. I decided to study tourism and that was when I started to travel to other countries and meet tourists in Iran. They turn out to be my friends and I am so happy to be in this path. Tourism gives me the opportunity to make new friends from all over the world and learn from them.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I like to be a minimalist in my life so I can spend time on the things that really matter in my life, like people and traveling. </span></p>
